Description: ADAM is a GSEA R package created to group a set of genes from
    comparative samples (control versus experiment) belonging to different
    species according to their respective functions (Gene Ontology and KEGG
    pathways as default) and show their significance by calculating p-values
    referring togene diversity and activity. Each group of genes is called GFAG
    (Group of Functionally Associated Genes).
