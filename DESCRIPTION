Description: Performs gene set enrichment analysis by grouping
    genes from comparative samples (control versus experiment) belonging to
    different species according to their respective functions (Gene Ontology
    and KEGG pathways by default), and evaluates their significance by
    calculating p-values for gene diversity and activity. Each group of genes
    is called GFAG (Group of Functionally Associated Genes).
